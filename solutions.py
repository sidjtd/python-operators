#1. Addition
#Add the two variables and store it to a new variable named sum.
#Print the sum variable.
sum = num1 + num2
print(sum)

#2 Subtraction
#Subtract the two variables and store it to a new variable named difference. 
#Print the difference variable.
difference = num1 - num2
print(difference)

#3 Multiplication
#Multiple the two variables and store it to a new variable named product. 
#Print the product variable.
product = num1 * num2
print(product)

#4 Division
#Divide the two variables and store it to a new variable named quotient. 
#Print the quotient variable.
quotient = num1 / num2

#6 Exponent
#Find the square of the num1 and store it to a new variable named square. 
#Print the square variable.
square = num1 ** 2

#7 Floor Division
#Divide the two variables to find the rounded down integer and store it to a new variable named int_div.
#Print the int_div variable.
int_div = num1 // num2
print(int_div)

#8 Comparison and Logic
#Declare a variable named is_equal and compare two strings 'Tacocat' and 'tacocat' using the equality (==) operator.
#Print the is_equal variable.
is_equal = 'Tacocat' == 'tacocat'
print(is_equal)

#9 Declare a variable named not_equal and compare the string value of '8' with the number value 8 using the inequality (!=) operator. 
#Print the not_equal variable.
not_equal = '8' != 8
print(not_equal)

#10 Assignment
#Declare a variable named num3 and assign it a number of your choosing.
